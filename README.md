## STAT 306 Project - Shinkansen Bullet Train Experience

This project was completed in April of 2024 as part of a third-year statistical modeling course at the University of British Columbia.

It aimed to analyze the passenger experience on Japanese Shinkansen bullet trains, and find the top 3 features that contributed to a positive experience. It utilizes logistic regression and several model-selection methods such as AIC/BIC values, backward/forward selection, and Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction.
